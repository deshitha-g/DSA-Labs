Exercise: 

Modify the given program to implement a binary search tree with the following basic operations. 
You have to define the below functions to implement the operations.
1. insertNode()
2. deleteNode()

â€¢ Additionally, you have to implement traverseInOrder() function to travese the BST inorder.
Do not modify the main function and other utility functions. You may implement any additional 
utility functions as you need.


Input Format :

Each line has two space-separated integers. The first integer is the operator (corresponds to the
integer above), while the second integer is the operand.
-1 marks the end of the input sequence.


Constraints:

1 <= operator <= 2
-10000 <= operators <= 10000


Output Format :

Prints the resulting BST after performing a sequence of insert and delete operations on the BST, 
using in order traversal. Each number is separated by a space.
