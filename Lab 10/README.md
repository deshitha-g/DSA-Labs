Expected submission:

  1. Write the adajaceny list representation for the graph in Fig1
  
  2. By using comments provided in the code, complete the following Node (struct), addedge, print functions
  
  3. Create graph object and add the graph in Fig.1.
  
  4. Print the adjacency list using the print function you implemented and take screenshot.
  
  5. What is the change you will make in the addedge function so that Graph ADT could accept directed graphs.(Instead of accepting undirected graph, 
     we need to accept directed graph). Write addedge altered function as your answer below.
