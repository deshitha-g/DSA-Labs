# DSA-Lab-12

Lab instruction:

Here we have 6 cities in a rural area. It has been estimated that for the population of all 6 cities building 1 hospital is sufficient and cost effective.
As part of the City planning division, you are tasked to decide which city we must build the hospital in. To do this one must think of alot constraints,
eg: one can decide to place the hospital at the city with the highest population among the 6 cities. Assume that all the other constraints
are equal in each city. You must place the hospital such that the ambulances in the hospital can attend to each city at the shortest time. The weighted
undirected graph provided in Fig.1 has cities as nodes and edges as average time taken from each city to another city(where possible not all
cities have roads between them).

Expected submission:

1. Write the weighted adajaceny matrix for the grap.
2. Implement SSSP Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.
